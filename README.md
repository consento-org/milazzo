# "How is Milazzo?" Concept

This week we came to Milazzo from all over Europe. [Daniel](https://github.com/dkastl) and [Martin](https://github.com/martinheidegger) came for the first time to this beautiful place!

In our interviews with people from Milazzo we noticed that there are a lot of different views on the City of Milazzo.

## Concept

We think Milazzo should collect and visualize independent data about Milazzo using sensors.

- Water quality sensors
- Air quality sensors
- Noise sensors
- Traffic sensors
- etc.

If this data is collected through sensors you can get a clear sense of the developments in the town and it becomes a tool to communicate around the things that need to be done better.

## Proposal

Georepublic can contribute its experience in standardizing and organizing environmental sensor data as Open Data. [Sensor Atlas](https://www.sensoratlas.com/) is an Open Source project that is compliant with the OGC [Sensorthings](https://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sensorthings) standard.

We will help [members](https://github.com/ledger-milazzo/org#open-government) to connect sensors to a data storage. If more than a 100 sensors are collected we will help you with the visualization of this data in a homepage.
